qwraps
======

Wrapper functions for producing base R plots using ggplot2.  Included functions are qacf(), qroc(), qsurvfit(), with more to come.

This is a very rough package as is.  A lot of work is left to do. 

TODO
1) help files
2) examples
3) code clean

## Development

To install the development version of qwraps, it's easiest to use the `devtools` package:
